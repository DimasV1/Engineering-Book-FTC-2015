\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item The time of beginning and ending of the meeting: 16:00 - 21:30.
	
	\item Purposes of the meeting: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Investigate about causes of extra friction in the lift and eliminate them.
		
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Today we did a research to find out about obstacles for moving of the slats. There was one problem: the distance between inside pairs of slats was too wide and caused a lot of friction. To solve this problem, we shortened the ribs and axles, which fixed pairs of rails and adjusted the width of both three elements of the lift. The movement of all the pairs of slats became easier, so now we won't waste power of motor on friction. Now, when the lift is improved, we can try to use blocks with cable instead of belt for lifting.
