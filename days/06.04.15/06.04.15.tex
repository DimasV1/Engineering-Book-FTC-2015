\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item The time of beginning and ending of the meeting: 16:10 - 21:50.
	
	\item Purposes of the meeting: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To make MEL with transmission with gear ratio 2:1.
		
		\item To test new MEL.
		
        \item To fix MEL on the body of robot.
		
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item New MEL was created and tested. Result is positive. Speed of lifting increased twice. But during the test threads that keep blocks torned. So it was decided to fix it by strong fishing cord.
		
		\item Also during the test we found that lift shakes when we rise it. It happend because rails extract not to maximal high. But we knew, how to solve this problem: install limiters which will not allow to rails rise too highly. Due to this limiters the slat will stop and so can't shake.
		
		\item In addition, we installed two new strong servos, which we got today, to the MOB.
