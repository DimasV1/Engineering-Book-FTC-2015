\subsubsection{12.04.15}
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item The time of beginning and ending of the meeting: 12:00 - 21:30.
	
	\item Purposes of the meeting: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To install blocks by the fishing cord.
		
		\item To install 5th and 6th motors to the wheel base.

	\end{enumerate}

	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Today we bought a fishing cord and fixed blocks with help of it. We tested strength of this mount. Result is positive. The cord is strong enough.

		\end{figure}
		
		\item It was found that backlashes of the installed chains are too big. So we corrected chain tension. Now backlashes are optimal.
		
        \item 5th and 6th motors for wheel base were installed and connected with other motors by the chain.

        \item In addition, today we made wiring for all motors.

	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Results:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Additional motors for wheel base were fixed.
		
		\item Blocks were fixed.
		
        \item Wiring for motors was made.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To fix MEL.
		
		\item To install limiters on the slats.
		
        \item To test the robot.
