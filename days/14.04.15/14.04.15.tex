\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item The time of beginning and ending of the meeting: 16:00 - 21:50.
	
	\item Purposes of the meeting: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Fix omniwheels permanently.
		
		\item To have a training in driving of the robot.
		
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Today we continued working on wheel base. Yesterday we installed omniwheels hestily, only to try this construction. However, after it showed itself more convenient than construction with basic wheels and we decided to use omniwheels permanently, we decided to fix wheels stronger.
		
		\item So, we fixed wheels to gears with screws and made the construction tighter in order to install stregthening plates from the sides. To fit plates between wheels and plexiglass protection, we had to shorten some details.

        \item After the plates were installed, we made a test run of the robot. Our robot moved and turned around extremly fast, but it was one difficulty that after the robot stops after a fast motion, it stands on forward wheels and in this moment apears the risk of overturning (for example, our robot overturned today once because of operator's mistake). At the end of training we investigated, that the robot stops fluently if we turn with one pair of wheels from the similar side. In that case we should practice doing this maneuver to avoid accidents.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Results:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Wheels were fixed with quality.
		
		\item Strethening plates were installed.
		
        \item We investigated, how to stop robot fluently. This will help us to avoid accidents with overturning of the robot.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Have more trainings.
		
		\item Set up servos on MOB and examine it.
			
	\end{enumerate}
