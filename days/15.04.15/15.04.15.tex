\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item The time of beginning and ending of the meeting: 18:00 - 23:00.
	
	\item Purposes of the meeting: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To set up servos on MOB.
		
		\item To install MCB with powerful servo and set up it.
		
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item We chose the correct difference between values of servos that move MOB. So there is no high load on it.
		
		\item It was found that servos were installed wrong. It overturned to extreme position but balls still didn't roll from it. So the position of servos was changede and now MOB works normally.
		
        \item MCB was changed. Servo was installed vertically because we couldn't install it horisontally due to additional motors that rotate wheels.
