	\item Purposes of the meeting: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To set up servos on MOB.
		
		\item To install MCB with powerful servo and set up it.
		
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item We chooses the correct difference between values of servos that move MOB. So there is no high load on it.
		
		\item It was found that servos were installed wrong. It overturned to extreme position but balls still didn't roll from it. So the position of servos was change and now MOB works normally.
		
        \item MCB was changed. Servo was installed vertically because we couldn't install it horisontally due to additional motors that rotate wheels.

	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Results:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Servos on MOB were set up.
