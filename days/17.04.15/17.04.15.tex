\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item The time of beginning and ending of the meeting: 16:00 - 00:00.
	
	\item Purposes of the meeting: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To fix the wheels.
		
		\item To train on the control robot.
		
		\item To write programme for autonomous period.
		
        \item To make a video about our robot.
		
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Wheels were fixed more reliable.
		
		\item The programme of control moving was changed. When operator press button-trigger robot move on a straight direction. When operator press right or left arrow on "TopHat" robot turn by both wheel pairs. And when operator press trigger and arrow on "TopHat" robot turn by one wheel pair. This programme is more comfortable for operator.
		
        \item We made a material for video about our robot.
        
        \item It was decided to install plexiglass for trainings because without it robot often run over small balls and it make control robot too hard.
        
        \item During the training screws that fix wheels and gears unwound again. So we fixed it by super glue. It will not allow them get off.

	\item Results:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Wheels and gears that rotate them were fixed more reliable.
		
		\item We made more comfortable programme of control moving.
		
        \item We made material for video about our robot.
        
        \item We trained on the control robot.
        
        \item We didn't write programme of autonomous period. 
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To train on the control robot.
		
		\item To write programme for autonomous period.
