\subsubsection{18.04.15}
Today was our last day of preparing for the competition in St. Louis. Tomorrow at 17:00 we'll go to Moscow by train and then fly from Moscow to the St. Louis through the New York City.\newline
Also today was an open door day in our lyceum and we participated there with our robot to involve new people into our robotics program. During the open day, we continued writing the program for automatization of the elevator.
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item The time of beginning and ending of the meeting: 15:20 - 00:00.
	
	\item Purposes of the meeting: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Make a code for automatically extracting of the lift in tele-op.
		
		\item Disassemble the robot for transportation.
		
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Work that has been done:
	\begin{enumerate} 
		
		\item During the trainings, 2 servos from the MOB suddenly broke down. It was a problem, because we had only 1 extra strong servo and no time to buy more. So, we decided to remake the MOB with another strong servo we had, but install the gear 1:3 for safety (although the bucket now overturns slower, it's less risk that it will break down).

		\item We installed a button, that the gutter presses when the lift is fully closed. It allows us to use the automatically lift extracting, because we can reset the value of MEL's encoder every time the bucket reaches the floor.

        \item We disassembled robot into parts to prepare it for transportation.

	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Results:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item We installed button for checking the bottom point of the motion of the lift.
		
		\item 2 servos from MOB broke down.
		
        \item Robot was disassembled for transportation.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Tasks for the next meetings:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item To show ourselves worthy at the competition in St. Louis.
			
	\end{enumerate}
