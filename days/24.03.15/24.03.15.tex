\subsubsection{24.03.15}

Today we had a one-day trip to Moscow. In Moscow we had been at the event "PTC Live Tech Forum" organised by our sponsors, company PTC. We were invited there by PTC to show how we use their software. There we presented our model of robot assembled in Creo Parametric 3.0.\newline
The second reason to visit Moscow was a number of special TETRIX detailes, which we ordered before. To take them we needed to meet the representative of PTC, Dmitriy Orlov.\newline
Also the forum was a good chance for us to meet new people who could cooperate with us or become our sponsors.\newline
During the forum, we continued working on our robot.
